## Business Track Application (Job Tracking System)

No design concerns were raised. We set out with the principle of writing clean code and aimed to write a system where a company can follow its internal business. The project consists of four layers: Web, Entities, DataAccess and Business. In addition to the asp net core 3.1 version, I also developed additional packages, which are widely used in the industry, by including them in the project. In the information below, there is information about what packages and which layer I use.
